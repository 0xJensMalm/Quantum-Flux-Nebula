# Quantum Flux Nebula

## Introduction

"Quantum Flux Nebula" is an interactive p5.js sketch that simulates the dance of particles within a nebula, inspired by the unpredictable and fascinating behaviors observed in quantum mechanics.

## Features

- **Dynamic Particle System**: Simulates thousands of particles moving and interacting within a boundary, creating a visually stunning nebula-like effect.
- **Variable Physics Modes**: Includes several "physics modes" such as "Backfire", "Basic", "Evil Eye", and "Star Birth", each altering the behavior and appearance of the particle system.
- **Interactive Boundaries**: The sketch features a boundary that can change shape, including circular, square, and triangular shapes, influencing how particles interact with the edges of the canvas.
- **Color Themes**: Offers a variety of color themes that change over time, adding depth and variety to the visualization.
- **Trail Effect**: Particles leave behind trails that fade over time, enhancing the visual complexity and beauty of the sketch.
